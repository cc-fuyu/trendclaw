## ✨ Key Features

- **📈 Multi-Source Data Pipeline**: Scrapes trending data, enriches it with deep metadata from the GitHub API, and compares it against historical snapshots.
- **🧠 AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses a configurable LLM backend (OpenAI, Ollama, OpenClaw) to identify categories, velocity signals, and key themes.
- **✍️ Multi-Format Content Generation**: Automatically generates digests, tweet threads, blog posts, and newsletters.
- **🔌 Flexible & Extensible**: Use it as a standalone CLI or as an OpenClaw plugin.

## 🛠️ How It Works

The pipeline is orchestrated in four main phases:

1.  **Scraper Agent**: A lightweight, dependency-free HTML parser scrapes `github.com/trending`.
2.  **Enrichment Agent**: Fetches deep metadata from the GitHub API and computes a diff against the previous day's snapshot.
3.  **Analyzer Agent**: Builds a rich context from all data sources and uses an LLM to extract structured insights.
4.  **Content Generator Agent**: For each requested format, this agent uses a specialized prompt to transform the structured analysis into polished, publishable content.

## 🔧 Development

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-trending-scout.git
cd github-trending-scout

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the TypeScript code
npm run build

# Run the CLI directly
node dist/cli.js --help
```
