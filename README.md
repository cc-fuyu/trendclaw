## ✨ Key Features

- **📈 Multi-Source Data Pipeline**:
    - **Trending Scraper**: Fetches daily, weekly, or monthly trending repos for any language using a dependency-free HTML parser.
    - **Deep Metadata Enrichment**: Fetches rich data from the GitHub API (issues, topics, commit activity, creation date) to add depth to the analysis.
    - **Historical Diff**: Compares today's trends with yesterday's to identify new entries, dropped repos, risers, and fallers.

- **🧠 AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses a configurable LLM backend to:
    - **Categorize** each repository (e.g., AI/ML, DevTools, Web).
    - **Explain *why*** it's trending in a single sentence.
    - **Identify Target Audience** and **Key Takeaway**.
    - **Calculate a Velocity Signal** (🚀, 📈, ➡️, 📉) based on star growth and commit activity.
    - **Identify cross-cutting themes** and a **"hot take"** on the landscape.

- **✍️ Multi-Format Content Generation**: Automatically generates content in various formats:
    - **Digest**: A scannable Markdown summary with tables and deep dives.
    - **Tweet Thread**: A viral-style X/Twitter thread with emoji and hashtags.
    - **Blog Post**: An 800-word article grouping repos by theme.
    - **Newsletter**: A developer newsletter edition with a spotlight and rising stars.

- **🔌 Flexible & Extensible**:
    - **Multi-LLM Backend**: Supports **OpenAI**, **Ollama** (for local models), and **OpenClaw Gateway** out of the box.
    - **OpenClaw Plugin**: Exposes a `github_trending_scout` tool for AI agents.
    - **Standalone CLI**: Run the entire pipeline from your terminal with `npx trending-scout`.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Standalone CLI)

## 🔌 OpenClaw Plugin Usage

1.  **Install the Plugin**: (Once published to npm)
    ```bash
    openclaw plugins install openclaw-github-trending-scout
    ```

2.  **Configure the Backend**: In your `openclaw.json`, configure which LLM to use.
    ```json
    {
      "plugins": {
        "trending-scout": {
          "llm": {
            "backend": "openclaw", // Use the native OpenClaw Gateway
            "model": "default"
          },
          "enableDeepMeta": true,
          "enableDiff": true
        }
      }
    }
    ```

3.  **Invoke from Chat**: Call the tool from your agent's chat interface.
    ```
    /github_trending_scout language=typescript formats=blog_post,tweet_thread
    ```

## 🛠️ How It Works

The pipeline is orchestrated in four main phases:

1.  **Scraper Agent**: A lightweight, dependency-free HTML parser scrapes `github.com/trending`.
2.  **Enrichment Agent**: Fetches deep metadata from the GitHub API and computes a diff against the previous day's snapshot.
3.  **Analyzer Agent**: Builds a rich context from all data sources and uses an LLM to extract structured insights.
4.  **Content Generator Agent**: For each requested format, this agent uses a specialized prompt to transform the structured analysis into polished, publishable content.

## 🔧 Development

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-trending-scout.git
cd github-trending-scout
